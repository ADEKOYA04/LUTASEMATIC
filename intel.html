          <h2>Fela Anikulapo Kuti</h2>
          <p>Fela Kuti, byname of Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, <br> also called Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, (born October 15, 1938, Abeokuta, Nigeria—died August 2, 1997, Lagos), Nigerian musician and activist who launched a modern style of music called Afro-beat, which fused American blues, jazz, and funk with traditional Yoruba music.

            Kuti was the son of feminist and labour activist Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti. As a youth he took lessons in piano and percussion before studying (1959) classical music at Trinity College London. While in London, he encountered various musical styles by playing piano in jazz and rock bands. Returning to Nigeria in the mid-1960s, he reconstituted Koola Lobitos, a band with which he had played in London. The Afro-beat sound emerged from that group’s experiments.</p>

          <h2>Albertina Sisulu</h2>
          <p>Albertina Sisulu was a nurse and freedom fighter. While working as a trainee nurse at Johannesburg General Hospital she encountered racism directly for the first time in her life — with her white counterparts treated as superior to the Black nurses. 

            Sisulu’s political journey began in 1984, when she joined the ANC Women’s League, the women empowerment division of the ANC. In 1956, Sisulu helped to organise the revolutionary anti-pass women's march. 
            
            In her opposition and activisim against the Bantu education system, which divided people racially and was aimed at limiting the futures of Black people, she turned her own Soweto home into a makeshift school for Black children until the government passed a law prohibiting it. </p>
